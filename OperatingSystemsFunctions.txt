One nice feature or function of the Ubuntu 13.10 operating system is the Keyboard Language Selector. You can swap between different language keyboards easily with a notification button. Shortcuts may also be made to switch language keyboards.
Ubuntu 13.10 also has Radeon UVD enabled which is handy for playing media. In the past other media players or software was required to use H.264 and VC-1 codecs. Now you should be able to play either of those formats immediately after launching the file in VLC.**
Ubuntu 13.10 and older versions include an open source version of Microsoft Office which doesn't have too many problems with files being read/written by each other. LibreOffice offers a Word, Excel and PowerPoint alternative and other Windows Office programs as well. I started using Ubuntu at a young age due to this reason as well. I did not want to pay for software that I use just to complete homework assignments (at that time at least).
GIMP (a photo editor) is included in Ubuntu for free! I used to edit photos or try designing logos for clubs so this free software is very handy. GIMP is much better than what is free on Windows for image editing (maybe not photos, but they do not provide a free photo editor), Windows Paint, and is also available on other operating systems partially due to being open source software.
