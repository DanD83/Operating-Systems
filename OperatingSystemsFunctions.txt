One nice feature or function of the Ubuntu 13.10 operating system is the Keyboard Language Selector. You can swap between different language keyboards easily with a notification button. Shortcuts may also be made to switch language keyboards.
Ubuntu 13.10 also has Radeon UVD enabled which is handy for playing media. In the past other media players or software was required to use H.264 and VC-1 codecs. Now you should be able to play either of those formats immediately after launching the file in VLC.
